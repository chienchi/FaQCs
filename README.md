PREREQUISITES
-------------

1. The main program is developed in Perl v 5.8.8.
2. Parallel::ForkManager module from CPAN   
   (http://search.cpan.org/~dlux/Parallel-ForkManager-0.7.9/lib/Parallel/ForkManager.pm)
3. String::Approx module from CPAN   
   (http://search.cpan.org/~jhi/String-Approx-3.27/Approx.pm)
4. R for ploting                 
   (http://www.r-project.org/)                             
5. Jellyfish for kmer counting   (Optional) 
   (http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/jellyfish/) 

Note: The two Perl modules can be installed by INSTALL.sh script in the lib directory.

    cd lib
    ./INSTALL.sh

-----------
BASIC USAGE
-----------

* Trimming by quality 5 and filtering reads with any ambiguous base or low complexity.

  $ perl FaQCs.pl -p reads1.fastq reads2.fastq -d out_directory

* Quailty check only on subsamples of input, no trimming and filtering. 

  $ perl FaQCs.pl -p reads1.fastq reads2.fastq -d out_directory -qc_only 

-----------
Full USAGE
-----------
     
    Usage: perl FaQCs.pl [options] [-u unpaired.fastq] -p reads1.fastq reads2.fastq -d out_directory

                          BWA trim is NOT A HARD cutoff! (see bwa's bwa_trim_read() function in bwaseqio.c)

            -q            <INT> Targets # as quality level (default 5) for trimming
    
            -5end         <INT> Cut # bp from 5 end before quality trimming/filtering 
      
            -3end         <INT> Cut # bp from 3 end before quality trimming/filtering 

            -adapter      <bool> Filter reads with illumina adapter/primers (default: no)
                          -rate   <FLOAT> Mismatch ratio of adapters' length (default: 0.2, allow 20% mismatches)
            					
            -artifactFile  <File>    additional artifact (adapters/primers/contaminations) reference file in fasta format 
    Filters:
            -min_L        <INT> Trimmed read should have to be at least this minimum length (default:50)

            -avg_q        <NUM> Average quality cutoff (default:0, no filtering)
            
            -n            <INT> Trimmed read has more than this number of continuous base "N" will be discarded. 
                          (default: 2, "NN") 

            -lc           <FLOAT> Low complexity filter ratio, Maximum fraction of mono-/di-nucleotide sequence  (default: 0.85)

            -phiX         <bool> Filter phiX reads (slow)
            
    Q_Format:
            -ascii        Encoding type: 33 or 64 or autoCheck (default)
                          Type of ASCII encoding: 33 (standard) or 64 (illumina 1.3+)

            -out_ascii    Output encoding. (default: 33)
    Output:
            -prefix       <TEXT> Output file prefix. (default: QC)

            -stats        <File> Statistical numbers output file (default: prefix.stats.txt)

            -d            <PATH> Output directory.
    Options:
            -t            <INT > # of CPUs to run the script (default:2 )

            -split_size   <INT> Split the input file into several sub files by sequence number (default: 1000000) 

            -qc_only      <bool> no Filters, no Trimming, report numbers.

            -kmer_rarefaction     <bool>   
                          Turn on the kmer calculation. Turn on will slow down ~10 times. (default:Calculation is off.)
                          (meaningless if -subset is too small)
                          -m  <INT>     kmer for rarefaction curve (range:[2,31], default 31)

            -subset       <INT>   Use this nubmer x split_size for qc_only and kmer_rarefaction  
                                  (default: 10,  10x1000000 SE reads, 20x1000000 PE reads)

            -discard      <bool> Output discarded reads to prefix.discard.fastq (default: 0, not output)
 
            -substitute   <bool> Replace "N" in the trimmed reads with random base A,T,C ,or G (default: 0, off)
 
            -trim_only    <bool> No quality report. Output trimmed reads only.
 
            -5trim_off    <bool> Turn off trimming from 5'end.

            -debug        <bool> keep intermediate files
